```
Subject: Brief Interview Request for Computer Vision Project

Dear Professor [Name],

I'm a graduate student working on a research tutorial about mobile 
door detection for accessibility (helping blind users navigate indoors).

Would you be willing to answer 2-3 brief questions via email?

1. What do you think is the biggest technical challenge in detecting 
   doors with smartphone cameras?

2. Recent research shows glass doors are very difficult to detect 
   (only 45-52% accuracy). Why do you think this is such a hard problem?

3. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like GPT-4V are now being explored 
   for door detection. Do you think foundation models will replace 
   traditional CNNs for this task?

Thank you for your time!

Best regards,
[Your Name]
[Your Email]
```

**When you get a response:**
1. Open `challenges.html` in Notepad
2. Find line ~100-120 with "Dr. Sarah Chen"
3. Replace with the real person's name and their response
4. Save (Ctrl + S)

**‚úÖ Success:** Real interview added to challenges.html!
