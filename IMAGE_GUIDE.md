## ‚úÖ Quick Checklist

Before submitting, verify:

- [ ] All 23 images are in the `images/` folder
- [ ] File names match exactly (case-sensitive!)
- [ ] Images are properly sized (not too large)
- [ ] Each image has a clear purpose
- [ ] Images are properly cited if borrowed

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Consistency:** Use similar style/quality for all images
2. **Clarity:** Make sure text/diagrams are readable
3. **Attribution:** If using others' images, cite in caption
4. **Compression:** Use TinyPNG.com to reduce file sizes
5. **Testing:** View images on both desktop and mobile

## üöÄ Fastest Approach

**Minimum viable images (if short on time):**

1. Take 5 photos of different doors with your phone
2. Add colored rectangles (bounding boxes) in PowerPoint
3. Export slides as images
4. Create 2-3 simple diagrams in PowerPoint
5. Search stock photos for the rest

**Time estimate:** 1-2 hours total

## üìß Need Help?

If you're stuck finding/creating images:
- Ask classmates to share resources
- Check course discussion board
- Email instructor for guidance
- Use simple diagrams instead of photos
