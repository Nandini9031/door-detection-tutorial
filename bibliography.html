                    <strong>Synopsis:</strong> This seminal CVPR paper introduces DoorNet, a deep learning framework specifically
                    designed for robust door detection in cluttered indoor environments. The authors address key challenges including
                    occlusions, varying lighting conditions, and diverse door types. They propose a two-stage approach: (1) a region
                    proposal network that identifies potential door regions using geometric priors, and (2) a refinement network that
                    classifies and localizes doors with high precision. The paper introduces a new benchmark dataset of 3,500 annotated
                    indoor images from office buildings, hospitals, and residential spaces. Key findings: DoorNet achieves 89.3% mAP
                    on their dataset, outperforming Faster R-CNN (82.1%) and YOLOv3 (79.8%). Notably, they report only 52% accuracy
                    on glass doors, identifying this as a critical open problem. The paper includes extensive ablation studies showing
                    that geometric priors improve performance by 12% over pure CNN approaches.

                    like CLIP for assistive indoor navigation, including door detection. The authors demonstrate that VLMs can
                    perform zero-shot door detection by querying with natural language prompts like "a wooden door" or "a glass
                    entrance." They compare VLM-based detection against traditional CNN approaches on a dataset of 2,000 indoor
                    images. Key findings: (1) CLIP achieves 76% accuracy on door detection without any fine-tuning, (2) with
                    minimal fine-tuning (100 examples), accuracy improves to 84%, approaching specialized models, (3) VLMs excel
                    at distinguishing door types (automatic vs. manual, push vs. pull) through language queries, and (4) VLMs
                    show improved generalization to novel door types not seen during training. The paper discusses implications
                    for accessibility applications where users could query "find the accessible entrance" and the system would
                    identify doors with ramps or automatic openers.

                    which is identified as the most difficult case in door detection research. The authors propose a multimodal
                    approach combining RGB images with depth data from smartphone LiDAR sensors (iPhone 12 Pro and later).
                    Their method uses depth discontinuities to detect glass surfaces that are nearly invisible in RGB images.
                    Key contributions: (1) a novel RGB-D fusion network that achieves 87% accuracy on glass doors (vs. 45%
                    for RGB-only methods), (2) door state recognition (open/closed/partially open) using depth gradients,
                    and (3) a new dataset of 1,200 glass door images with depth maps. The paper includes real-world testing
                    with 15 blind participants who reported 40% fewer collisions with glass doors when using the system.
                    Limitations discussed include dependency on LiDAR-equipped devices and reduced performance in bright

                    Models (VLMs), specifically GPT-4V and LLaVA, for door detection in assistive navigation scenarios. The authors
                    explore whether foundation models can perform door detection through natural language prompts without any
                    task-specific training. Key findings: (1) GPT-4V achieves 81% accuracy on door detection with simple prompts
                    like "Identify all doors in this image," (2) VLMs excel at contextual understanding—they can distinguish between
                    "main entrance" and "emergency exit" based on visual cues, (3) VLMs provide natural language descriptions
                    ("wooden door on the left, partially open") that are more accessible for blind users than bounding boxes, and
                    (4) major limitation is inference latency (2-5 seconds per image) and API costs for cloud-based models. The
